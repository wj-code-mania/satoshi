; You could host the entire project in your local web server, by using tools like
; [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/) or [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
; Once done, you could easily open the samples by opening the matching URL. For e.g.:
; `http://localhost/php-client/sample/index.php`
test.baseUrl = http://dev.blockcypher.github.io/sample/
; If you are running PHP 5.4 or greater, PHP provides a built-in support for hosting PHP sites.
; The fastest way to get it running is
; php -f sample/index.php
;test.baseUrl = http://localhost:5000
